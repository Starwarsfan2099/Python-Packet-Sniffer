# Python-Packet-Sniffer
This packet sniffer is meant to for new python programmers to learn how to program with sockets in Python. This will not capture any passwords and just prints domains to the output. This won't even read addresses from browsers, but from the most basic requests like the ping command. This can be run on Linux (as root) or Windows (Adminstrative CMD).
